This directory contains model definitions for WHIZARD / O'Mega generated by the
FeynRules - WHIZARD interface. In order to use them, you need a working
installation of WHIZARD 2.x and must compile and install the files using the
included build system.

To this end, configure the sources using the configure script

   ./configure --prefix=/installation/prefix WO_CONFIG=/path/to/wo/binaries

where "--prefix" and "WO_CONFIG" are optional. The latter must be set to the
path containing the WHIZARD binaries if they can't be found in any of the paths
in the PATH environment variable, while the first can be used to tune the
installation directory of the model files (${HOME}/.whizard by default).

After configuration, compile and install the source by doing

   make clean && make install

If the model was either installed into the default prefix or into the WHIZARD
prefix, it will be found WHIZARD without any further intervention. If a
different prefix was chosen, please use the "--localprefix" to point the
"whizard" executable to the correct path.
